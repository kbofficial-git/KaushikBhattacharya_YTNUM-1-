YouTube Mindful Watching – UX Redesign (Figma)
This project addresses the issue of compulsive binge-watching on YouTube's mobile platform through subtle, user-friendly interface design. Built entirely in Figma, the goal was to create an experience that helps users become more mindful of their watch time—without disrupting the core engagement flow.

🔍 Problem Statement:
How can we discourage compulsive binge-watching without hurting engagement?

🧠 Key Features Implemented:
🎯 Micro-Interactions to Promote Break-Taking
    - Added a “Take a Breather” reminder with a one-click 1-minute break mode (breathing animation & return).

🛠️ Tools Used:
Figma for UI/UX design and prototyping.
Smart Animate for smooth transitions.
Prototyping interactions for seamless flows.
